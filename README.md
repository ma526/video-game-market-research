# video-game-market-research

I am trying to apply all the things I learned about spreadsheets and data analytics so far to study video game sales worldwide!

I picked up datasets of a company that is creating video games and I am trying to research the market to better understand what kind of video games are in demand and how the trends are evolving. I will explore a custom dataset and quantify several factors that affect video game sales worldwide. The dataset contains information about sales of video games launched in year 2018, with total sales calculated from their launch date up until 08/22/2024.
